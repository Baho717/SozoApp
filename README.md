# SozoApp
This is an application that serves as a one stop for all your medication and doctors appointment needs.

- **Feature Changed From Initial Proposal:** 
Make at least one unit test.<br/>
I believed that adding a day notification was more practical than a unit test. I will revisit this over the break.

## Technologies
- **Backend** - C# 10 
- **ORM** - EF 6
- **Database** - SQL
- **Frontend** - Razor/HTML/JS/CSS

## Patterns
- MVC (Model, View, Controller)
- Code First Database Creation

## Getting Started
1. Clone git@github.com:Baho717/SozoApp.git
2. Navagate to the source folder
3. Run 'dotnet run'

## Features:

- [ ] Ability to view, add, edit, and delete current medication information.
- [ ] Ability to view, add, edit, and delete medication history.
- [ ] Ability to schedule doctors visits.
- [ ] Ability to take notes at doctors visits for future reference.

##Todo
- [ ] Build new c# .NET mvc app
- [ ] Create Models for the Database
- [ ] Integrate EF 6 into project
- [ ] Scaffold DB and Controllers/ View Based on Models
- [ ] Customize the solution to show off my skills
